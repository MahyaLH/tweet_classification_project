# tweet_classification_project

Welcome to the cumulative project for classification! In this project, we have used real tweets to find patterns in the way people use social media.

There are two parts to this project:

In the first part, we've made a system that predicts whether or not a tweet will go viral by using a K-Nearest Neighbor classifier. What features of a tweet do you think are the most important in determining its virality? Does the length of the tweet matter? What about the number of hashtags? Maybe information about the account that sent the tweet is most important. We have answered these questions while using DataFrames and Matplotlib visualizations to present the results!

In the second part of this project, we've tested the power of Naive Bayes classifiers by creating a system that predicts whether a tweet was sent from New York City, London, or Paris. we've investigated how language is used differently in these three cities. Can the classifier automatically detect the difference between French and English? Can it learn local phrases or slang?
